During the period of a woman's cycle she goes through four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall). To keep track of these changes this small webapp allows you to download an .ics file with 5 events.
The 5 events are the seasons as all-day-events with a description of each season, as well as the start of your next period. 
All the informations used on this pages are built uppon this blog post:
